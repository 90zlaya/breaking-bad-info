> Simple Vue.js app with Breaking Bad info

## Description

Idea is to create simple Vue.js project to demonstrate development skills in this awesome JS framework.

## Look and feel

Currently project looks like this:

![][breaking-bad-overview]

But have in mind that this image might stay few commits behind.

## Build setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compiles and hot-reloads for development
npm run serve

# Compiles and minifies for production
npm run build

# Lints and fixes files
npm run lint
```

After installing dependencies and running app, visit [localhost:8080] to enjoy app functionality. For detailed explanation on how things work, consult [configuration reference]
