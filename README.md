> A simple Vue.js app with Breaking Bad info

## Description

Idea is to create simple Vue.js project to demonstrate development skills in this awesome JS framework.

## Look and feel

Currently project looks like this:

![][breaking-bad-overview]

But have in mind that this image might stay few commits behind.

## Build setup

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production with minification
npm run build
```

After installing dependencies and running app, visit [localhost:8080] to enjoy app functionality. For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader].

[localhost:8080]: http://localhost:8080
